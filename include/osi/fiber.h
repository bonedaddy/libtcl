 * The main difference between fibers and functions is that a fiber can be

 * another fiber is one way to suspend a fiber, but thatâ€™s more or less the
 * same as one function calling another.
 *
 * Things get interesting when a fiber yields. A yielded fiber passes control
 * back to the fiber that ran it, but remembers where it is. The next time the
 * fiber is called, it picks up right where it left off and keeps going.
 *
 * @param context The argument which is the result of `fiber_call'.
